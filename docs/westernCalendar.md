## Psalms

The recitation of the Psalms is central to daily worship throughout the whole of Christian Tradition.

Anglicanism at the time of the Reformation established that the entire Psalter should be read in the Daily Office once each month, according to the pattern printed with this Lectionary.   Contemporary practice sometimes lessens the number of the daily psalms, which practice is permissible as long as the entire Psalter is regularly read.  For any day, the psalms appointed may be reduced in number according to local circumstance.  If there is only one office, the psalms may be drawn from those appointed for Morning or Evening that Day.  If a two month cycle of psalms is desired, the Morning psalms may be read in one month and the Evening psalms in the next.  When there is a thirty-first day of the month, psalms from the Psalms of Ascents, Psalms 120 to 134, are used.

The Gloria Patri may be said after each psalm, or at the conclusion of all the psalms of the day.  The manner of recitation of the psalms can be adapted to size of congregation and physical setting: responsive, antiphonal, or unison, and by whole or half verse.  For purposes of reflective pause, half-verse recitation or musical chant, the asterisk (*) printed in each verse indicates the place where the verse divides.

Psalms proper to a feast or fast day, or to the lessons appointed for the day, may be substituted for those provided in the thirty day cycle.

## Annual Cycle of Lessons

The principle adopted at the Reformation was that “the whole of Holy Scripture (or the greatest part thereof)” should be read each year.  This cycle of lessons is based on that principle.  Much of the New Testament is read twice.

When a Lesson begins with a pronoun, the reader shall substitute the appropriate noun. Verses printed within parentheses are permissive additions to the appointed passages. The letter “a” after the number of a verse signifies the first part of that verse, and the letter “b” the second part.

# Movable feast days

Movable feast days are calculated based on Easter Sunday.

First Sunday of Advent is closest Sunday to November 30.
